So you want to create a website? Look no futher than Python and the Flask web framework. Are you looking at creating a static website, that just services static information to your audience, or a full fledged website with dynamic content. Nevermind Flask can do it all. Okay maybe using Flask to serve static web pages might be a bit of overkill, but it`s always a good start into web development and it provides you with the opportunity to scale a static site into a dynamic information asset for yourself or organisation.

In order for this starter tutorial to make sense I would assume you have some basic knowledge of the following components, else following the links to gain a basic understanding of these topics before contiuning:
* [Python](https://www.google.com "What is Python")
* [PIP](https://www.google.com "What is PIP")
* [HTML](https://www.google.com "What is HTML")
If you are comfortable with the above topics you can skip over and get started below

### What is a web framework
A Web framework is a collection of packages or modules which allow developers to write [Web applications](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebApplications "Web Applications") or services without having to handle such low-level details as protocols, sockets or process/thread management.

As a developer using a framework, you typically write code which conforms to some kind of conventions that lets you "plug in" to the framework, delegating responsibility for the communications, infrastructure and low-level stuff to the framework while concentrating on the logic of the application in your own code. This "plugging in" aspect of Web development is often seen as being in opposition to the classical distinction between programs and libraries, and the notion of a "mainloop" dispatching events to application code is very similar to that found in [GUI programming](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming "GUI programming").

Generally, frameworks provide support for a number of activities such as interpreting requests (getting form parameters, handling cookies and sessions), producing responses (presenting data as HTML or in other formats), storing data persistently, and so on. Since a non-trivial Web application will require a number of different kinds of abstractions, often stacked upon each other, those frameworks which attempt to provide a complete solution for applications are often known as full-stack frameworks in that they attempt to supply components for each layer in the stack.
