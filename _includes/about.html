      Currently I`m part of an R&D team working towards reducing credit risk through ongoing event management. We are working on a project where we collate multiple data sources and build up graph networks to represent a single connected view for each credit application. These graphs are then processed on a daily basis identifying possible credit risks in a more proactive fashion.
